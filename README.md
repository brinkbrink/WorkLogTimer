# WorkLogTimer
Created to keep track of time spent on small tasks (responding to messages, etc) for hourly contract work

To use:

1. Clone repo or save python file and csv file to your local computer.
2. Navigate to the directory you saved the files in with your computer's terminal.
3. Enter the command `python timer.py`.
4. Type `start` to start the timer.
5. Type `pause` to pause the timer.
6. Type `resume` to resume the timer.
7. Type `stop ` to stop the timer and add the date and amount of time elapsed to `hours.csv`.
8. Type `exit` to exit the process, stop the timer, and add the date and amount of time elapsed to `hours.csv`.

If you choose to rename the csv file you will need to change the file-path name in the python file.
